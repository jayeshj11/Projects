Hello,

This is a game I coded in python using objectived oriented programming.
Please run connect_4.py in the shell and give the command "game()".

Upon starting the game, the game will give you these options for Player 1 and Player 2 - 
  1. Choose for Player 1 (X) -
    a. Human Player
    b. Random Player
    c. AI Player
      - Choose the level of difficulty (1,2,3 and 4)
      
  2. Choose for Player 2 (O) -
    a. Human Player
    b. Random Player
    c. AI Player
      - Choose the level of difficulty (1,2,3 and 4)
