Hello,

This is a game I coded in python using objectived oriented programming.
Please run connect_4.py in the shell and the game shall start automatically.
If you wish to play the game again just give the command "game()" in the console.

Upon starting the game, the game will give you these options for Player 1 and Player 2 - 
  1. Choose for Player 1 (X) -
    a. Human Player
    b. Random Player
    c. AI Player
      - Choose the level of difficulty (1,2,3 and 4)
      
  2. Choose for Player 2 (O) -
    a. Human Player
    b. Random Player
    c. AI Player
      - Choose the level of difficulty (1,2,3 and 4)

Hope you enjoy the game!
