I used the sample text from Shakespeare provided on the CS Website, and an excerpt from a book called 'The Monk who sold his Ferrari' by Robin Sharma to compare to my WR100 paper about free speech, an excerpt from ruskin bond's book "Road to Mussoorie", an excerpt from Chetan Bhagat's book and an excerpt from JK Rowling's book. I think as a reader my thoughts might have been influenced by the book I read, but since Shakespeare has given most of the words to the English dictionary, the chances of my writing being similar to Shakespeare's are pretty high. I also compared the other 3 to see if the Indian writers were more influenced by Shakespeare or by a fellow Indian writer and the opposite case for JK Rowling.

According to the results, my text is more likely to have come from Robin than the other one and the results for Shakespeare's text were much less than that for Robin. I think the program works pretty well but if added more features, the program could be much more close to perfect. I think the text classification could have been better if we compared the occurrences of a set of words and checked their appearance in all the documents. One more feature that we could improve is that the program should be able to analyse and give scores irrespective of their lengths and have an equal scale.
